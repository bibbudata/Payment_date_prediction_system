# Payment_date_prediction_system
- A payment date prediction model for B2B Invoice Management
- Uses Machine Learning to predict the expected due date and the delay bucket for clients based on previous transactions
- The initial dataset contains fields for previous transactions of businesses and we use machine learning to predict the date of the payment clearance using Supervised Learning
- Python and its libraries are used to predict the model (pandas, numpy, seaborn, scikitlearn)
- Predicts the date as well as the supposed delay bucket as:
    - 0-15 days
    - 15-30 days
    - 31-45 days
    - 46-60 days
    - greater than 60

- Prediction done using regression
